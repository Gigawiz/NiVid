NiVid is a video streaming application designed to share videos with your friends.
By streaming over UDP, NiVid allows you to stream as fast as possible without needing insanely fast internet.
Each client gets their own unique id, that gets generated by the NiCoding API. Every time you connect to the service,
your connection password is updated and waiting for connections. Wnen you enter an id of a partner to connect to,
the program calls the API, returns the ip address of the ID you entered, then the program will connect you to that partner.
